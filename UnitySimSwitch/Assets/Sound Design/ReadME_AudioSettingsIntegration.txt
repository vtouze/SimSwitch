The volume settings system has already been developed and includes two audio mixers: SFX and Music.

When adding an Audio Source component to a GameObject, please ensure you select the correct Output in the Audio Source settings:

	- Use the SFX Mixer for sound effects (e.g., UI sounds, environment sounds, etc.).
	- Use the Music Mixer for background music or music tracks.

This ensures proper volume control and integration with the existing audio settings system.
