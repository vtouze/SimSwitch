  _subheading: 'While the world is still struggling to overcome the after-effects
    of the COVID-19 pandemic, worrying rumors are circulating: a new virus has appeared
    in China, and experts fear it could soon reach Europe. International health authorities
    are on the alert, and the first preventive measures are being put in place. For
    European citizens, still marked by the confinements and restrictions associated
    with COVID, this new announcement raises concerns and questions.'

  _description: 'A circulating virus and limited information: At this stage, little
    official information has filtered through on the nature and danger of this new
    virus. The Chinese authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) are closely
    monitoring the situation and studying the initial data, but remain cautious.
    Some experts fear a respiratory virus with symptoms similar to those of COVID-19,
    which could complicate its diagnosis and management. Research laboratories are
    stepping up analyses to better understand its mode of transmission and its potential
    for spread. Return of health vigilance in Europe: In Europe, precautionary protocols
    are already under discussion. Airports are strengthening controls on flights
    from China, and some governments are discussing the reintroduction of screening
    and isolation measures if necessary. Health systems are preparing for a possible
    influx of patients in the event of a spread of the virus, even if no cases have
    been detected on the continent so far. A worried but more prepared population:
    For citizens, the possibility of a new epidemic revives recent and difficult
    memories. However, mentalities have changed, and Europeans are now more familiar
    with barrier gestures and health protocols. "We have learned to live with the
    health threat," confides a Parisian nurse, "but the hope of turning the page
    is fading with this worrying news." Faced with this situation, caution remains
    essential. The authorities recommend avoiding unnecessary travel and following
    the evolution of official information. If the threat of an epidemic remains hypothetical
    for the moment, Europe, scalded by COVID-19, is ready to react to avoid a new
    pandemic scenario. //Effect: decrease in the popularity of public transport /
