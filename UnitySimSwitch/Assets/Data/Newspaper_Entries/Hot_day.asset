  _eventName: 'Hot days: A record year for extreme temperatures'
  _date: September 21, 2024
  _subheading: "This summer will be remembered as one of the hottest in decades.
    The country recorded several hot days, with temperatures regularly exceeding
    35\xB0C in many regions. This series of heat waves highlights the effects of
    global warming and raises growing concerns about the consequences for health,
    the environment and infrastructure."

  _description: "Record temperatures: Since June, France has been hit by successive
    heat waves. Temperatures have exceeded exceptional thresholds, particularly in
    the south and west of the country, with peaks exceeding 40\xB0C in some areas.
    Paris, Bordeaux, Toulouse and Marseille have seen their thermometers reach levels
    rarely seen at this time of year. In some regions, nighttime temperatures have
    not fallen below 25\xB0C, exacerbating the heat felt during the day. Meteorologists
    attribute this intensification of heat waves to a global climate phenomenon,
    where global warming promotes the rise in temperature of air masses. \"We are
    observing a marked trend towards extreme weather events, with more frequent and
    more intense heat waves,\" explains Claire Durand, a climatologist at the CNRS.
    Consequences for health and infrastructure: Days of extreme heat have direct
    repercussions on public health. Hospitals have seen an increase in admissions
    related to heat stroke, dehydration and respiratory problems, particularly among
    vulnerable populations: the elderly, children and those with chronic diseases.
    The Ministry of Health has launched awareness campaigns to remind people of the
    importance of protecting themselves from the heat, drinking regularly and avoiding
    physical exertion in direct sunlight. The impact on infrastructure is also worrying.
    Power grids are under intense pressure, due to high demand for air conditioning
    and cooling. Some regions have even experienced temporary power outages, while
    the distribution system is struggling to cope with record consumption. In addition,
    the high temperatures have increased the risk of forest fires, particularly in
    the Var, Gironde and Corsica, where several devastating fires have required the
    intervention of firefighters. Awareness of climate change: Faced with these repeated
    hot days, calls for action against climate change are increasing. Authorities,
    scientists and environmental associations are stressing the need to reduce greenhouse
    gas emissions and adopt adaptation measures in the face of these increasingly
    frequent phenomena. \"Heat waves are just one of the visible signs of global
    warming. Urgent action is needed to limit the damage,\" warns Thierry Vives,
    head of an environmental NGO. At the same time, initiatives are being implemented
    in cities to combat the effects of urban heat. Greening projects, urban umbrellas
    and the creation of green spaces are being studied to limit the effect of heat
    islands in urban areas. Some municipalities have also extended the opening hours
    of municipal swimming pools or set up \"climate refuges\" to offer cool spaces
    to the population. The urgency of adaptation: While this year has marked a turning
    point in terms of heat, it also highlights the urgency of adapting our lifestyles
    to a rapidly changing climate. Urban planning, water resource management and
    heat management awareness will need to be priorities in the coming years. As
    the summer of 2024 draws to a close, it is clear that extremely hot days will
    become more frequent. The question now remains how to prepare for them and how
    to protect the health of the French in the face of increasingly extreme temperatures.
