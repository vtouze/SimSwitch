  _date: September 26, 2024
  _subheading: 'The electronics industry is facing an unprecedented crisis: electronic
    components are in short supply and prices are soaring. Due to exponential demand
    and limited supply, companies are struggling to procure the chips, semiconductors
    and other elements essential to the manufacture of products ranging from smartphones
    to automobiles. This shortage is hitting technology industries hard, leaving
    them unable to meet market needs.'

  _description: "Surging demand and limited production capacity: The crisis is caused
    by a combination of factors. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused demand for electronic
    devices to explode, particularly for teleworking and digital entertainment. At
    the same time, production plants, mainly concentrated in Asia, have been slowed
    by strict health measures and logistical problems related to travel restrictions.
    The result: demand that far exceeds global production capacity. Struggling industries:
    The impact of this shortage is being felt across a range of sectors. Car manufacturers,
    which rely heavily on electronic components for their vehicles, have had to reduce
    production, with some even temporarily suspending assembly lines. Manufacturers
    of telephones, computers and game consoles are also affected, leading to delays
    in the release of new products and higher prices for existing models. Soaring
    prices and longer delivery times: Faced with this supply squeeze, component prices
    have increased significantly, which could be passed on to consumers. Delivery
    times, once a few weeks, are now stretching to several months for some components.
    \u201CProduction costs are exploding, and it is becoming difficult to guarantee
    reasonable deadlines,\u201D explains a manager of a technology company. Towards
    a rebalancing of the market? Major semiconductor manufacturers have announced
    massive investments to increase their production capacities, but experts estimate
    that it will be at least one or two years before seeing a rebalancing of the
    market. In the meantime, the shortage is forcing companies to review their production
    and to prioritize components for their most profitable models, hoping that the
    market will eventually regain stability. In this tense context, consumers risk
    seeing the prices of electronic products rise, while companies will have to adapt
    to this new market reality. //Effect: increase in the price of technology projects
