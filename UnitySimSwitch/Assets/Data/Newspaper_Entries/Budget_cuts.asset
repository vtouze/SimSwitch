  _description: "The State has confirmed a \u20AC5 billion cut in grants to local
    authorities, impacting budgets for infrastructure, schools, and public services.
    Announced in the draft finance bill, this aims to control deficits but raises
    concerns about significant consequences. Local authorities, heavily reliant on
    state funds, fear closures, reduced services, or tax increases. Small municipalities,
    particularly vulnerable, face challenges maintaining essential services, while
    departments funding social action are in a precarious position. Associations
    of elected officials warn of increased inequalities, urging alternatives like
    reducing central state spending or combating tax evasion. Amid economic pressures,
    this measure highlights tensions between fiscal responsibility and territorial
    solidarity."
