  _description: "A safety-focused cycling license: Cyclists start with points deducted
    for infractions like running red lights or riding on sidewalks, with potential
    fines. Losing all points results in a temporary ban until completing an awareness
    course. This measure, addressing rising bike accidents, aims to promote responsible
    cycling. While some praise improved safety, others fear it discourages cycling.
    Associations argue for better infrastructure over stricter rules. The license
    will be tested in major cities before nationwide implementation, marking a shift
    in France\u2019s soft mobility approach."
