  _eventName: A points-based cycling license to regulate urban cycling
  _date: September 26, 2024
  _subheading: In response to the increase in the number of cyclists and the number
    of accidents involving them, the French government has taken the unprecedented
    step of introducing a points-based cycling license for anyone wishing to cycle
    on public roads. The aim of this scheme is to make cyclists more aware of their
    responsibilities, guarantee road safety and provide a better framework for the
    use of this rapidly expanding mode of transport.

  _description: 'A license to supervise the safety of cyclists and pedestrians: This
    points-based license, which will work in a similar way to that of motorists,
    will initially assign a capital of points to each cyclist. In the event of infractions
    such as not respecting red lights, riding on sidewalks, or using a phone while
    riding, points will be withdrawn, along with possible fines. If the cyclist loses
    all his points, he will be temporarily prohibited from riding his bike on public
    roads until his points are recovered after an awareness course. A response to
    the increase in bicycle accidents: The authorities justify this measure by the
    increase in the number of accidents involving cyclists, who are increasingly
    sharing the roads with motorists and pedestrians. By introducing this license,
    the State hopes to raise awareness among cyclists of traffic rules and reduce
    risky behavior. "The bicycle is an ecological and accessible means of transport,
    but it must be used responsibly," explains the Ministry of Transport. Mixed reactions
    in the cycling community: This new regulation has provoked mixed reactions. While
    some welcome the desire to introduce better safety, others fear that it will
    discourage the use of cycling and penalize an already fragile mode of transport.
    Cyclists'' associations denounce an excessive measure and instead advocate for
    the improvement of infrastructure, such as the creation of secure cycle paths
    and reinforced signage, to better protect users. The points-based cycling license
    will be tested in several large cities before potentially being generalized to
    the entire territory. In the meantime, this new regulation marks a turning point
    in the approach to soft mobility in France, with the ambition of making the roads
    safer for everyone, including cyclists. //Effect: decrease in the popularity
    of cycling / decrease in cycling accidents'
