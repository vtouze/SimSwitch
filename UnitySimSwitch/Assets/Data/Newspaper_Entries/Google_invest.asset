  _description: Google, through Sidewalk Labs and partnerships, promotes eco-friendly,
    intelligent transport solutions like autonomous vehicles and shared mobility.
    However, some see these investments as a way for Google to expand its data collection
    and control over urban infrastructure, enhancing services like Google Maps. While
    aiming for sustainable mobility, Google's involvement also raises concerns about
    data privacy and its commercial interests in shaping future transport technologies.
