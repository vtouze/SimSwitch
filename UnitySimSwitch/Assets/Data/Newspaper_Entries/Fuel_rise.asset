  _eventName: 'Fuel price hikes: an unprecedented surge'
  _date: September 26, 2024
  _subheading: 'French motorists are bitterly reminded of this every time they go
    to the pump: petrol and diesel prices are reaching unprecedented heights. With
    an increase of several centimes per liter every week, fuel costs are weighing
    ever more heavily on household budgets. The surge in oil prices is linked to
    tensions on the international market, where growing demand and supply disruptions
    are driving up prices.'

  _description: "Heavy consequences for households and businesses: The rise in fuel
    prices has a direct impact on households\u2019 purchasing power, particularly
    for those living in rural or peri-urban areas, where cars are often essential.
    \u201CEach tank of fuel now costs me almost 20% more than a year ago, it\u2019s
    become difficult to make ends meet,\u201D confides a father. Many workers are
    feeling the same pressure, especially since the increases are also reflected
    in the cost of consumer goods, via the rise in transport costs. Calls for help
    from associations and unions: Faced with this situation, several consumer associations
    and unions are asking the government for measures to reduce the bill for individuals,
    such as targeted aid or a temporary reduction in fuel taxes. In a context where
    the ecological transition is pushing people to consider alternative solutions
    to the thermal car, many are nevertheless calling for increased support for the
    development of public transport infrastructure and aid for the purchase of electric
    vehicles. A challenge for the energy transition: This surge in fuel prices is
    a reminder of the urgent need to diversify energy sources and reduce dependence
    on fossil fuels. But while waiting for alternative solutions to become accessible
    to all, consumers are suffering the effects of an increasingly unstable oil market.
    For many French people, this surge remains a symbol of energy insecurity, leaving
    them hanging on market fluctuations, in the hope of finding some stability at
    the pump. //effect: increase in the price of car use"
