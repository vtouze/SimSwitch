  _subheading: "For several months now, Europe has been plagued by capricious weather:
    incessant rain, grey skies and showers have followed one another over the seasons,
    leaving the inhabitants with little respite. Precipitation records have been
    broken in several regions, and \u201Cfine weather\u201D seems to have deserted
    the forecast. This year, bad weather is definitely not taking a vacation, and
    the consequences are mounting."

  _description: 'A climate that disrupts daily life: This year''s persistent rains
    are impacting many sectors. In agriculture, harvests have suffered from excess
    water and lack of sunlight. Wheat, fruit, and vegetable crops are showing lower
    yields, increasing the pressure on farmers already affected by rising costs.
    On the tourism side, professionals are also seeing a drop in attendance: outdoor
    destinations have looked gloomy this summer, and many vacationers have preferred
    to cut short their stays or change their plans in the face of unpromising weather
    forecasts. A phenomenon that raises questions: simple cycle or disruption? Meteorological
    experts explain that this phenomenon may be linked to the climatic upheavals
    that our planet is experiencing. Changes in atmospheric circulation, accentuated
    by global warming, are causing more frequent extreme weather events, including
    prolonged rain episodes. However, it is difficult to predict whether this year
    is the start of a new trend or whether the climate cycle will gradually return
    to "normal". A daily life to reinvent under the gray sky: The inhabitants, themselves,
    adapt as they can. Umbrellas have become daily companions, waterproof clothing
    is essential, and indoor activities have become part of daily life. While some
    appreciate the charm of rainy days, many dream of finding a lasting ray of sunshine
    again. Faced with this "year in the rain", everyone is wondering: will the good
    weather return, or will we have to get used to this humid climate that is changing
    our habits? // Effect: decline in popularity of active modes / shift to private
    cars'
