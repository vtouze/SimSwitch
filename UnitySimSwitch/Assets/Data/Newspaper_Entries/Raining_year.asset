  _description: Persistent rains this year are disrupting daily life, affecting agriculture
    with lower crop yields and tourism with fewer visitors to outdoor destinations.
    Experts link the weather to global warming, though it's unclear if this is a
    long-term trend. People are adapting with umbrellas and waterproofs, but many
    are left wondering whether the weather will improve or if the humid climate will
    continue, forcing them to adjust their habits.
