  _description: " Inflation, averaging 6.2% in 2024, is impacting consumers and businesses,
    especially with rising food, energy, and housing costs. Households are adjusting
    budgets, prioritizing essentials. Low-income families suffer the most. While
    the government has introduced aid measures, they\u2019re insufficient for many,
    and trade unions call for wage increases. Experts predict inflation will decelerate
    slightly, but challenges remain, especially in energy and raw materials. The
    government's efforts to stabilize the economy may not fully restore purchasing
    power."
