  _description: "Investments for a greener future: The plan provides financial support
    to encourage municipalities to develop less polluting transport networks, install
    charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, and encourage the use of public
    transport. Cities of all sizes are concerned, from the modernization of urban
    bus fleets to lighter transport in rural areas. The focus is on the electrification
    of lines, the development of cycle paths, and the creation of high-level bus
    networks. More resilient and better adapted transport: This major plan also aims
    to strengthen the resilience of transport systems in the face of increasingly
    frequent climatic events. Municipalities will receive funds to improve the safety
    of infrastructure in the face of storms, floods and heat waves. \u201CIt is not
    only about making our transport greener, but also safer and more accessible,\u201D
    explains the Minister of Transport. As part of this project, innovative solutions
    will be explored to adapt public transport to the challenges of tomorrow. A commitment
    to efficiency and the well-being of citizens: With this plan, the State reaffirms
    its commitment to providing citizens with quality public transport, essential
    to their daily lives. Local elected officials are delighted with this aid, which
    will relieve often limited municipal budgets. For many citizens, this initiative
    represents the hope of seeing less polluting, more regular transport that is
    better adapted to their needs. By making transport more ecological and more efficient,
    the State hopes that this transformation will encourage more citizens to turn
    to collective or soft means of transport, for a more sustainable future and a
    more pleasant daily life. //Effect: increase in the budget for investment in
    transport"
