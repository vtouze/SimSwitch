  _description: The plan provides financial support to municipalities to develop
    greener and more resilient transport systems. It focuses on electrifying lines,
    creating cycle paths, and improving public transport for all areas. The initiative
    aims to strengthen infrastructure against climate events like storms and floods,
    ensuring safer, more accessible transport. Local governments welcome this aid,
    which will relieve budgets, and citizens hope for less polluting, more reliable
    transport. This transformation encourages more sustainable travel, fostering
    a greener future and improving daily life.
