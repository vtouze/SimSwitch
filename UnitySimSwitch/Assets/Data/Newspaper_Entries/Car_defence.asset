  _description: 'Targeted actions against soft mobility: Protesters have vandalized
    bike paths, pedestrian areas, and EV stations, claiming hostility toward cars.
    This highlights tensions between ecological transition and freedom of movement.
    While supporters seek cleaner, safer cities, car defenders argue for their essential
    role, especially in suburban areas. Public reactions are mixed, with calls for
    dialogue and balanced solutions. Mayors insist soft mobility is here to stay,
    urging cooperation to avoid radical actions.'
