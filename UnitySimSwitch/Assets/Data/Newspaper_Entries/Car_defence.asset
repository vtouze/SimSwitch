  _eventName: 'Movement to defend the car: hard-hitting actions against the reduction
    of dedicated space'
  _date: September 26, 2024
  _subheading: "Faced with the proliferation of bicycle paths, pedestrian zones and
    spaces reserved for public transport, some motorists are voicing their discontent.
    A movement dubbed \u201CD\xE9fense de la voiture\u201D (Defense of the car) has
    recently been formed, bringing together enthusiasts who feel that their \u201Cliving
    space\u201D is threatened by policies in favor of soft mobility. Their demand
    is clear: give cars back the space they once occupied. But these sometimes virulent
    actions are controversial."

  _description: "Targeted actions against soft mobility infrastructure: The movement
    has already launched several shock operations. Some infrastructure dedicated
    to bicycles or pedestrians has been vandalized, and charging stations for electric
    vehicles have been damaged. The protesters believe that these infrastructures
    encroach on their right to move freely and claim that public space has become
    \u201Chostile\u201D to cars. These actions, which are intended to be symbolic,
    are often carried out at night and mainly target large cities where pedestrianization
    plans are most advanced. A debate between freedom of movement and ecological
    transition: This increase in tension highlights the debate between two visions
    of mobility. On the one hand, supporters of the ecological transition advocate
    for less polluted cities and safer streets, by encouraging soft mobility such
    as cycling or walking. On the other hand, defenders of the car believe that this
    transformation is to the detriment of their freedom of movement. \u201CThe car
    remains an essential tool, especially for those who live on the outskirts. We
    cannot all switch to cycling or public transport,\u201D underlines a member of
    the movement. Mixed reactions and calls for dialogue: These actions, although
    in the minority, are generating mixed reactions in public opinion. Some motorists\u2019
    associations are calling for more consultation and transition solutions that
    take everyone\u2019s needs into account, while municipalities are pointing out
    that reducing the number of cars is a response to the challenges of pollution
    and urban safety. In response to the deterioration, mayors of large cities are
    calling for dialogue and pointing out that soft mobility infrastructure is here
    to stay. In this tense context, the challenge will be to find a balance between
    the different road users and to make these visions of urban mobility coexist
    without resorting to radical actions. //Effect: deterioration of active infrastructure
    & public transport / increase in public transport and active infrastructure insecurity"
